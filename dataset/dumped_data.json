With Friday's numbers showing the addition of 217,000 jobs, the U.S. finally restored the 9 million jobs lost in the recession -- five years after it supposedly ended.

This is a majority-Russian region, and Putin has been both ruthless and deft at using thuggish locals as cats' paws for an eventual takeover. Obama is pursuing economic sanctions and threatening more sanctions, despite being undercut by our European allies. The U.S. is pursuing Containment II to try to isolate Russia that is not all that dependent on global trade, and the original Containment took more than four decades.
